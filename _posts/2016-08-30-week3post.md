<br>It's 2016. Nowadays, it's often easier to take notes with \{{ insert fav note taking app \}} rather than lugging your notebook and stationery around. For the obstinate people, 53 has presented a delightful alternative to both our traditional media (actual pen and paper) and our laptops.

## Huh Paper & Pencil?
Just to recap, **Paper** is a free iOS drawing app that provides a canvas and a selection of virtual stationery for you to do everything from note-taking to sketching. **Pencil** (US$60) is a odd-shaped stylus for the iPad. With the release of the Pencil SDK, it now not only integrates well with Paper (duh), but also works with OneNote, Adobe Illustrator Draw, Autodesk's Sketchbook and many others. 

## Pencil for Painters, Paper for Professionals

The landing pages for **Pencil** and **Paper** seem to market to different audiences. 

The Pencil landing page highlights 4 key features: 
1. Surface Pressure detection
2. Eraser on the other end
3. Blending colors with your finger
4. Palm rejection 

With the exception of maybe 3, the rest are useful features for most everyone, and not just artists. Despite this, all 4 of these features are accompanied by a pretty piece of art.   

In contrast, **Paper** plays up its productivity features, and seems to be appealing to the professional crowd who would use the app for taking notes, annotating photos or creating high-quality sketches.
