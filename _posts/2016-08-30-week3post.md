<br>It's 2016. Nowadays, it's often easier to take notes with ** < insert fav note taking app > ** rather than lugging your notebook and stationery around. For the obstinate people, 53 Inc. has presented a delightful alternative to both our traditional media (actual pen and paper) and our laptops.

## Huh Paper & Pencil?
Just to recap, **Paper** is a free iOS drawing app that provides a canvas and a selection of virtual stationery for you to do everything from note-taking to sketching, while **Pencil** (US$60) is a odd-shaped stylus for the iPad. With the release of the Pencil SDK, it now not only integrates well with Paper (duh), but also works with OneNote, Adobe Illustrator Draw, Autodesk's Sketchbook and many others. 

## Pencil for Painters, Paper for Professionals

The landing pages for **Pencil** and **Paper** seem to market to different audiences. 

The Pencil landing page highlights 4 key features:

1. Surface Pressure detection
2. Eraser on the other end
3. Blending colors with your finger
4. Palm rejection 

With the exception of the color-blending feature, the rest are useful features for most everyone, and not just artists. Despite this, pretty pieces of art are used to exemplify each of these 4 features.   

In contrast, **Paper** plays up its productivity features, and seems to be appealing to the professional crowd who would use the app for taking notes, annotating photos or creating high-quality sketches.

This seems kinda weird given the way 53 Inc. has built an entire community around sharing their sketches on Paper via Mix. With a strong community of artists using Paper, does it really make sense for them to be targeting the professional crowd?

My initial idea of their ideal target customer was a typical 20-30yrs old office worker, but looking at some of their older pages, I realised they were really targeting professional **designers** who could use the app's sketching features to quickly prototype their products for clients. This made much more sense, since designers aren't that far divorced from artists (to me anyway).
