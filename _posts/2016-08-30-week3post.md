<br>It's 2016. Nowadays, it's often easier to take notes with **insert fav note taking app** rather than lugging your notebook and stationery around. For the obstinate people, 53 Inc. has presented a delightful alternative to both our traditional media (actual pen and paper) and our laptops.

## Huh Paper & Pencil?
Just to recap, **Paper** is a free iOS drawing app that provides a canvas and a selection of virtual stationery for you to do everything from note-taking to sketching, while **Pencil** is a odd-shaped stylus for the iPad.

## Pencil for Painters, Paper for Professionals
![Target Audience]({{ site.url }}/images/mkting.JPG)
The landing pages for **Pencil** and **Paper** seem to market to different audiences. 

The Pencil landing page highlights 4 key features:

1. Surface Pressure detection
2. Eraser on the other end
3. Blending colors with your finger
4. Palm rejection 

With the exception of the color-blending feature, the rest are useful features for most everyone, and not just artists. Despite this, pretty pieces of art are used to exemplify each of these 4 features.   
In contrast, **Paper** plays up its productivity features, and seems to be appealing to the professional crowd who would use the app for taking notes, annotating photos or creating high-quality sketches.

This seems kinda weird given the way 53 Inc. has built an entire community around sharing their sketches on Paper via Mix. With a strong community of artists using Paper, does it really make sense for them to be targeting the professional crowd?
