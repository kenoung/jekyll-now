This is a platform that systemically leeches the effort of the hardworking and helpful to help those who can't be bothered to organize their own deadlines hehe. The system is built around different modules, so when you add a deadline for a certain module, the deadline syncs to everyone else taking that module. You'll get credited for any deadline you contribute, so you'll also be earning some street cred along the way! Check it out [here](https://schoolines.com/)! 

# And that concludes Assignment 3
In the beginning, we were thinking of throwing in plenty of cool ideas like adding in cool visualizations of your deadlines, a voting system to act as a check for deadline authenticity etc. Towards the end, we had to give up all of those, and focus on making sure we fixed all the little bugs, improve the UI, and push out a working product.

All in all, I think we were able to do a pretty good job, and this is something I would be proud of showing off to my friends and students. (:

# Future Plans??
As I mentioned in a previous post, this is something I wanted to push to my students, and I started thinking of additional really practical features that would be really useful! If I had the time, I'd want to add in these features to the app:

1. App Notifications! It would be nice to have a reminder when a deadline is approaching. Of course, they'd also need to be able to easily turn off notifications for certain deadlines, or only activate deadlines for specific modules.

2. Categories! It's midterm season, and I think it would be cool if students could easily filter out all the deadlines, and just look at when the midterms are. (Btw, I know NUSMods already has support for Finals timings. Would be cool if you guys could add in the timings for midterms as well HAHAHA)

3. Suggest edit/Report deadline? We didn't include a reporting feature because we felt that putting the contributor's name there would be sufficient to deter people from adding spammy or fake deadlines. But that doesn't stop people from making mistakes. Anyone who spots a mistake should be able to suggest an edit (like in Wikipedia?) or flag it. When this happens, a notification can be sent to the contributor for him to check and review his deadline. It should also be possible for others to see the flag count of a deadline, so they have a heads-up that the deadline might not be accurate. After a certain number of flags, we can also hide the deadline until the contributer has reviewed it or until he accepts a suggested edit

# Final project!
Really excited to be doing my final project with Patrick, Ten and ZhuoHan. I've worked with Patrick and Ten before so I'm aware of their workstyles. Idk ZhuoHan but he comes highly recommended by Pat so I'm sure we'll get along fine ^^. That said, we'll be working on a phone game, with plans to use React Native. Time to learn another new framework... *crying emoji*
