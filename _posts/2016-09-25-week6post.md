This is a platform that systemically leeches the effort of the hardworking and helpful to help those who can't be bothered to organize their own deadlines hehe. The system is built around different modules, so when you add a deadline for a certain module, the deadline syncs to everyone else taking that module. You'll get credited for any deadline you contribute, so you'll also be earning some street cred along the way! Check it out [here](https://schoolines.com/)!
