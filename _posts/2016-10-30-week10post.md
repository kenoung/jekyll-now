## UI Fixes
After our UI consultation with Su Yuen, we realised that while our site looked beautiful, it wasn't intuitive for users. She had no idea what the site was about, and didn't know why she would want to "give a gift". The key takeaways from the meeting were:

1. Make sure users know what your site is about. Immediately.
2. Guide users every step of the way. What's next?
3. Messaging is really important. Every button should be appropriately named.

She has agreed to take another look at our site after we've implemented the changes so we're looking forward to that.

## Onboarding Charities
SPCA has kindly agreed to join us, and Red Cross seems interested as well (we just need to fill up some forms and stuff...). We're also talking to Cat Welfare Society and the Society for the Physically Disabled. 

## Getting Givers
On Friday, Patrick and I went door-to-door in COM2 to introduce Give For Free to the Professors and Teaching Assistants. Most of them were really friendly and visited GiveForFree.sg. We even met a PhD researcher who gave us a UI evaluation on the spot :')

We were also able to obtain plenty of valuable feedback. For example, some of them really hated that we requested permission to post for them on Facebook (maybe it's just SoC peeps being paranoid), so we decided to remove that entirely, and use the Facebook Share Dialog to allow them to share stuff themselves.

## Getting Donors
As our site is not up yet, we're focusing on getting people to visit our prelaunch page (so we can capture their emails and inform them when the site is ready). We've been driving traffic to the page mainly via our Facebook giveaway but the response so far has been dismal. We should probably re-evaluate our campaign and see if we can do something else to get more visitors.
