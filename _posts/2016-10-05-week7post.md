To achieve the second aim, we found a cool package called [Reinspect](https://github.com/Russell91/ReInspect) which counts the number of people in an image. So while the others are working on the hardware (Ten), the web server (Patrick) and the UI (Zhuohan), I'm figuring out how to make a function that takes in images and spits out people counts. But before I could even dive into Reinspect, the dependencies alone took me an incredible amount of time to set up. So for the blog post this week, I'll be documenting how I set up CPU-only Caffe and ApolloCaffe on a Ubuntu 16.04 Digital Ocean Droplet.

## (Some of the) Stuff I referenced
There was plenty of existing documentation on installing Caffe on Ubuntu, but some of the stuff just didn't work for me, and I had to google around for fixes to all the problems I was facing.

## Creating A New Droplet on DigitalOcean (Skip if you already have a server)

If you don't have an account yet, sign up using my [affiliate link](https://m.do.co/c/015107e3eb11) plzzzz. You get $10 free! Oh but if you're a student, go get your free $50 worth of DigitalOcean credits using [Github's Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

Anyways, I'm a poor student trying to conserve credits, so I went ahead to get the cheapest droplet (**IMPT**: you can still choose to upgrade your droplet to get more RAM and CPU cores, but you can't downsize it later if you choose a big droplet here).

<img style="min-width: 200px; width: 50%; float: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px" src="{{ site.url }}/images/resize.JPG"> After getting whatever size droplet you have, be sure to resize it at least temporarily to the biggest size you can get your hands on. This ensures that you have sufficient memory to compile and install Caffe and ApolloCaffe. I was hitting into plenty of compile errors until I realised that the gcc compiler was out of memory. You can also use a swap file, but apparently that's not recommended for the SSDs that DO uses for your droplets.

## Installing Caffe Dependencies
Now it's time to SSH into your server and install all your dependencies. 

```
sudo apt-get install -y libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-numpy python-scipy
sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-dev
```

## Compiling Caffe
### Download the files from github
```
mkdir caffe && cd caffe
wget "https://codeload.github.com/BVLC/caffe/zip/master"
sudo apt-get -y install unzip
unzip master -d caffe
rm master
```

### Compile
```
cd caffe/caffe-master/
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
```

You'll need to make the following changes to your Makefile...

*here*
```
# Uncomment the CPU_ONLY line if you're installing the CPU only version
CPU_ONLY := 1
```
and *here* (Note: These edits are related to the changes in the hdf5 install directory locations.)
```
# I had problems with hdf5 cos apparently hdf5 changed their install directory locations
# So make sure you note the following changes to the include_dirs and library_dirs
WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1

INCLUDE_DIRS := $(PYTHON_INCLUDE) /usr/local/include /usr/include/hdf5/serial

LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
```

I think you're making some symlinks here?
```
find . -type f -exec sed -i -e 's^"hdf5.h"^"hdf5/serial/hdf5.h"^g' -e 's^"hdf5_hl.h"^"hdf5/serial/hdf5_hl.h"^g' '{}' \;

cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

sudo ln -s libhdf5_serial.so.10.1.0 libhdf5.so

sudo ln -s libhdf5_serial_hl.so.10.0.2 libhdf5_hl.so 
```

Install the related python libraries from the python directory (found in the caffe-master directory you unzipped).
```
cd ~/caffe/caffe-master/python

for req in $(cat requirements.txt); do sudo -H pip install $req; done
```

And now it's time to run make. The -j8 flag is to use all 8 available cores. Change the number if you're not using that many, or just remove it altogether if you only have one core. 
```
sudo make all -j8
sudo make test -j8
sudo make runtest -j8
sudo make distribute -j8
```

If you're only installing Caffe, run the following to add it to the python path. **Do not run this** if you're installing ApolloCaffe as well.
```
export PYTHONPATH=~/caffe/caffe-master/python:$PYTHONPATH
```

## Installing ApolloCaffe
Now let's install ApolloCaffe.
```
git clone http://github.com/Russell91/apollocaffe.git && cd apollocaffe
for req in $(cat python/requirements.txt); do sudo -H pip install $req; done

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/apollocaffe/build/lib # contains libcaffe.so
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/apollocaffe/python

cp ../caffe/caffe-master/Makefile.config Makefile.config
sudo make -j8
sudo make test -j8 && make runtest
```

At this point, test your install using Python. Try importing caffe, apollocaffe and cv2.

```{python}
import caffe
import apollocaffe
import cv2
```

If you can do all these without running into any import errors, you're done. 

## Install OpenCV 
At this point, I had an error with the cv2 import, and I fixed this by reinstalling OpenCV (Referenced this [gist](https://gist.github.com/BloodAxe/6441766)).

### Download OpenCV files
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
curl -sL https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/master.zip > opencv.zip
unzip opencv.zip
rm opencv.zip 
```

### Configure & install OpenCV
```
mkdir opencv-build
cd opencv-build/
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_OPENEXR=OFF ../opencv-master/
sudo make install -j8
```

Now test your cv2 import again. I can't help you if it still doesnt work :)

And you should be done!

### Reinspect
If you're interested in Reinspect...
```
git clone http://github.com/russell91/reinspect
cd reinspect 
pip install jupyter
pip install munkres
make eval
```
