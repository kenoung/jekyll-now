title: Installing Caffe and ApolloCaffe on Ubuntu 16.04

To achieve the second aim, we found a cool package called [Reinspect](https://github.com/Russell91/ReInspect) which counts the number of people in an image. So while the others are working on the hardware (Ten), the web server (Patrick) and the UI (Zhuohan), I'm figuring out how to make a function that takes in images and spits out people counts. But before I could even dive into Reinspect, the dependencies alone took me an incredible amount of time to set up. So for the blog post this week, I'll be documenting how I set up CPU-only Caffe and ApolloCaffe on a Ubuntu 16.04 Digital Ocean Droplet.

## (Some of the) Stuff I referenced
There was plenty of existing documentation on installing Caffe on Ubuntu, but some of the stuff just didn't work for me, and I had to google around for fixes to all the problems I was facing.

## Creating A New Droplet on DigitalOcean (Skip if you already have a server)

If you don't have an account yet, sign up using my (affiliate link)[https://m.do.co/c/015107e3eb11] plzzzz. You get $10 free! Oh but if you're a student, go get your free $50 worth of DigitalOcean credits using (Github's Student Developer Pack)[https://education.github.com/pack].

Anyways, I'm a poor student trying to conserve credits, so I went ahead to get the cheapest droplet (IMPT: you can still choose to upgrade your droplet to get more RAM and CPU cores, but you can't downsize it later if you choose a big droplet here).

<img style="min-width: 200px; min-height: 100px; float: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px; padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px" src="{{ site.url }}/images/resize.JPG"> After getting whatever size droplet you have, be sure to resize it at least temporarily to the biggest size you can get your hands on. This ensures that you have sufficient memory to compile and install Caffe and ApolloCaffe. I was hitting into plenty of compile errors until I realised that the gcc compiler was out of memory. You can also use a swap file, but apparently that's not recommended for the SSDs that DO uses for your droplets.

## Dependencies

```
#!/bin/sh
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-pip
sudo apt-get install -y python-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python-numpy python-scipy
sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-dev
```

## Compilation
### Clone
```
wget "https://codeload.github.com/BVLC/caffe/zip/master"
sudo apt-get -y install unzip
unzip master -d caffe
rm master
```

### Compile
```
cd caffe/caffe-master/
cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
```
Make the following changes to your Makefile.
```
# Uncomment the CPU_ONLY line if you're installing the CPU only version
CPU_ONLY := 1

# I had problems with hdf5 cos apparently hdf5 changed their install directory locations
# So make sure you note the following changes to the include_dirs and library_dirs
WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1

INCLUDE_DIRS := $(PYTHON_INCLUDE) /usr/local/include /usr/include/hdf5/serial

LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial
```

Other hdf5 stuff that I don't really get either.
```
find . -type f -exec sed -i -e 's^"hdf5.h"^"hdf5/serial/hdf5.h"^g' -e 's^"hdf5_hl.h"^"hdf5/serial/hdf5_hl.h"^g' '{}' \;

cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

sudo ln -s libhdf5_serial.so.10.1.0 libhdf5.so

sudo ln -s libhdf5_serial_hl.so.10.0.2 libhdf5_hl.so 
```

Go back to the root directory and do this
```
cd python

for req in $(cat requirements.txt); do sudo -H pip install $req; done
```

sudo make all -j8
sudo make test -j8
sudo make runtest -j8
sudo make distribute -j8

export PYTHONPATH=~/caffe/caffe-master/python:$PYTHONPATH
