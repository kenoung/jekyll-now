title: final week for assignment 3
---

The latest version of the app is hosted [here](https://schoolines.com/). 

## Assignment 3 UI
The front-end UI is still not ready for the world, so we haven't launched it to our friends yet. The things I hope can get fixed by Monday would be:

1. Nice colors and proper padding? (i think pink and bright red are icky)
2. A decent timepicker (right now our timepicker is a simple input field)
3. Hide functionality (easily hide unwanted deadlines)

## Getting People To Use The App
I'm actually pretty confident that there will be people to use this app once it's built. I'd start by asking my students (from 1010S) to start using. They're last minute people, and almost always submit on the last day. This app would be super useful for them to keep track of all their missions and sidequests. 

It's also midterms period now. It'll be really great if this app was already functional, so people can keep track of when their midterms are! (note to self: would be good to be able to filter by event type)

## Serviceworkers
It's probably time to start looking at this LOL. On the bright side, we have our production server set up with SSL already, so that's a good thing.

## Final sprint
With one week left to go, I hope we can pull together and make this project a success!
